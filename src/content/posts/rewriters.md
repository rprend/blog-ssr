# Rewriters

Back in 2023, I was obsessed with the idea of fine tuning an AI to be like specific people. I made two of them.

The first is a joke rewriter trained on the jokes of Norm MacDonald, my all time favorite comic. https://grinn.vercel.app/

The second is a novel rewriter trained on Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, one of my favorite books. https://stylistic.vercel.app/
