    "content": "<h1>Book Review- Lacan by Lionel Bailey</h1>\n<p>There is a contradiction in human desire, which prevents a simple answer to the simple question &quot;What do you want&quot;? From apathy over what to eat for dinner, to torturous dissatisfaction on what to do with your life, uncertainty plagues humanity. It&#39;s so intuitive it seems natural, but it&#39;s not obvious why. Surely, the animal who knows what he wants-- whether food, activity, or entertainment-- would outcompete the anxious one, plagued by uncertainty? Yet humans, the most uncertain of creatures, thrive. why?</p>\n<p>Even people who do sit down and reflect and think really hard and try to come up with an answer for &quot;what do I want, fundamentally&quot; come up frustratingly short. They tend to speak in dubious negations, write down maxims like &quot;being is where it is not&quot;, and become religious or meditators or psychedelics. Lost to the world of woo.</p>\n<p>Psychoanalysis offers a striking answer for why desire is alienating, and it does so while avoiding much of the floofiness of Woo. The answer: it&#39;s built into <strong>the way that humans become conscious</strong>. It&#39;s structural and inherent like a magnet&#39;s attraction to the opposing pole. Desire is alienating because it is the desire of &quot;The Other&quot; -Lacan.</p>\n<p>Jacques Lacan (1901-1981) was a psychoanalyst, a disciple of Sigmund Freud. He built upon the Freudian theories of psychosexual development and unconscious desires, expanding them into a narrative of <strong>why</strong> and <strong>how</strong> humans desire. Like other narrative simplifications of complicated systems, I&#39;m not sure how literally true Lacan&#39;s ideas are, if at all. But as a <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/08/book-review-the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions/\">framework</a> for understanding the contradictions of human psychology, I&#39;m blown away.</p>\n<p>As a psychoanalyst and a public intellectual and most of all a French psychoanalytical public intellectual, Lacan was prone to the redefinition of common words with specific directional meanings. The Real, the Imaginary, the Symbolic, the Other, the object cause of desire, jouissance, the phallus, the Thing, signifier, signified. All of these concepts are defined to answer a few central questions: What do humans desire? Why do they desire such things Where does desire live and how is it created? I&#39;ll trace his ideas as he does: through the development of human consciousness, and how a person develops his place in the world.</p>\n<h2>The Birth of Consciousness</h2>\n<p>Consciousness doesn&#39;t exist, and then it does. At what point does the baby become aware of itself? For Lacan, there is an easy and explicit answer: <strong>the mirror stage</strong>.</p>\n<p>A baby looks into a mirror, and recognizes himself. Unlike the bear in the wild who attacks the mirror, the baby looks at the mirror and sees &quot;me&quot;. But consciousness requires more than that. Self consciousness develops at precisely the moment when the baby recognizes that it is NOT him in the mirror. The image he sees of himself in the mirror is just that--an image-- and not himself. Me but not me. I see myself, but it&#39;s not truly me, it&#39;s an image of me. This is a moment of identification (literally, he sees himself as the object in the mirror), and he invents a concept of &quot;myself&quot;. This moment is the invention of the ego, and the first time that the baby experiences a sense of self separate from its environment.</p>\n<p>The moment of self consciousness is the first step on the formation of desire. We move chronologically through the baby&#39;s life.</p>\n<h2>The Baby&#39;s Development</h2>\n<p>To Lacan, the infant stage of development from a blabbering, incoherent infant to a speaking, walking toddler, is the origin of desire and its structure. We trace a story that&#39;s perhaps a little too-neat-to-be-true, but is neat nevertheless.</p>\n<p>The infant&#39;s entire world is his mother. At the moment of the mirror stage, he recognizes himself as separate from his mother, and he also recognizes that his mother perceives him as an image. like the one he saw of himself in the mirror. Nevertheless, the infant is entirely dependent on the mother-- for food, moving around, rest. The infant is helpless on his own. We transcribe the infants worldview as such:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mother is all powerful. Mother gives me food, gives me life.</p>\n<p>For some intangible reason, mother takes care of me. When I cry, she consoles me. When I&#39;m hungry, she feeds me.</p>\n<p>There must be some reason that Mother takes care of me. There must be something about ME. Something about ME that she wants, I am what she wants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, Mother doesn&#39;t always take care of Baby. Every baby pushes it&#39;s limits to the point it is ignored. Throwing its food on the floor, declaring it disgusting, crying senselessly-- every parent at some point draws the line and refuses to give in to the baby&#39;s demands. Furthermore, simple pragmatism prevents the baby from commanding Mother&#39;s attention 24 hours a day. Mother has to go to work; Mother has to go to bed. To the baby, this is startling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mother is all-powerful, and I am what Mother wants. But Mother doesn&#39;t always give me what I want. Mother does other things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is tension; this is torture. It demands resolution. If mother is all powerful, and I am what Mother wants, then why would she not give me what I want? Is she some arbitrary and capricious tyrant? Resolution comes in accepting what Lacan calls the Paternal Metaphor, whereby the name of the Father comes to stand for &quot;Mother must&quot;. Mother and Father here don&#39;t have to literally be the mother and father, as they are used metaphorically. &quot;Mother&quot; is the primary caretaker of the baby, and Father for the primary excuse the mother has for leaving the baby (could be the father, work, etc). The baby accepts that Mother is not all-powerful, that Mother must submit to the rules and demands of some other authority, and the demands of this other authority can be symbolized by the name of the Father. That is to say, that the father&#39;s name stands-in as a symbol for the rules and laws mother must abide by.</p>\n<p>The acceptance of the paternal metaphor introduces the first <strong>symbol</strong>, a term Lacan borrows from Saussarian Linguistics, meaning &quot;phrase-image&quot;. The distinction between signal and signified is commonly explained as &quot;the map is not the territory&quot;, that a map of St Louis is not literally St Louis, while simultaneously representing it.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s at the moment that the child acquires language by &quot;crossing the bar of metaphor&quot; between signifier and signified that he becomes fully conscious. He understands an intangible set of rules and norms which he symbolizes with the Name of the Father. And in that moment of symbolization, something is split in his consciousness, what Lacan call his Subject. There is something missing in the map&#39;s symbolization of the territory, and likewise there is something missing in the paternal metaphors articulation of &quot;what the mother wants&quot;.</p>\n<p>This moment is a tremendous loss for the child, who previously understood himself to be the object of his mother&#39;s desire. The quality of being wholly desired, Lacan calls the Phallus. Again, this is metaphorical. And the child who once believed himself to possess the phallus now understands himself to have lost it. He lost it (although really he never had it), and for the rest of his life he will chase its fragments in things he think might give it back to him. He sees fragments of the phallus in the world-- maybe if he masters electric guitar, maybe if he can run the fastest marathon, maybe then he will be whole again.</p>\n<p>This is the genesis of desire. The introduction of language causes his subject to split, and he loses the fantasy of omnipotence he enjoyed in the phallus. This moment—the loss of the phallus—lays the foundation for desire. As the child’s world expands, he meets and talks with new people and the paternal metaphor grows into a set of phrases and symbols called The Other. His understanding of himself and others is governed by language, symbols, and social rules.</p>\n<h2>Desire</h2>\n<p>Desire is the byproduct of language in the other. It is the result of the impossibility to fully articulate demands, or, well, anything.</p>\n<p>Desire arises where need and demand diverge. Language allows us to articulate demands—what we ask of others—but in doing so, it transforms raw need into something symbolic and incomplete. What is spoken is never quite what we truly need. The baby says &quot;bottle&quot; or &quot;mama&quot; but what it needs is something that’s not quite that. The gap between demand and need is where desire is born, endlessly circling around the unattainable object of fulfillment.</p>\n<p>More sophisticated language doesn&#39;t solve this- its fulfillment becomes more complex too!</p>\n<p>Back to our starting questions: Why does one desire? Whence does desire arise? By what process?</p>\n<p>Desire grows around objects that fulfill a psychological need rather than a physical one. You don&#39;t know what you want for dinner because it isn&#39;t about dinner-- it&#39;s about the impossible, unspoken, alienated aspect of your wants. Your asking not asking &quot;what do I want?&quot; but rather &quot;what will make me feel whole?&quot; and the answer to that is &quot;nothing&quot;. That&#39;s the nature of desire.</p>\n<h2>What this all means</h2>\n<p>I skipped a bunch-- this is the starting point of Lacan&#39;s theory of consciousness and desire. His writing quickly get wordy and complex: for example, he plots the topological vector-space of all aspects of desire, the three dimensions being the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic. He was a fan of pseudo-mathematical formulations of metaphorical processes. His precise definition of the paternal metaphor is:</p>\n<p><code>S1 / s1 x S2 / s2 -&gt; S2 / (S1 / s1)</code></p>\n<p>S1- signifier of the mother&#39;s desire</p>\n<p>s1- signified idea of the object of mother’s desire, phallus</p>\n<p>S2- Signifier of the father</p>\n<p>s2- signified idea of the father</p>\n<p>We didn&#39;t even touch his primary source for all this theory, which is psychoanalysis. Lacan worked his whole life split between the university in seminar and the insane asylum, attempting to understand and cure France&#39;s craziest patients. His practice would appear to those familiar with &quot;Therapy&quot; (CBT) weird, bizarre, and unscientific, with a mostly silent Lacan interjecting with puns or nonsense phrases, and sessions ending seemingly randomly. Take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA-SXCGwLvY\">this clip</a> of a former patient of his, recalling how he interjected her session with a pun on Gestapo and &quot;geste à peau&quot; (gesture), and that moment cured her.</p>\n<p>Lacan believed language to be the root of all ills. He wrote that the unconscious was structured itself as a language of signifiers-- signifiers which were repressed from the conscious. His goal as an analyst was to become a perfectly transparent mirror, so that the patient sees himself through the eyes of The Other. Hopefully, in that perfect mirror state, as the patient speaks, either the patient independently discovers or Lacan guides him towards the &quot;master signifier&quot; organizing his unconscious. In that moment, the patient&#39;s master signifier is spoken, and the patient&#39;s Subject is articulated, the ultimate goal of Lacanian psychoanalysis.</p>\n<h2>Why he matters</h2>\n<p>With all that said, Lacan is the most important psychoanalyst since Freud, and his influence continues to grow since his death. Ironically, much of the interest in his work comes from academics OUTSIDE psychoanalysis. Within the psychoanalytical mainstream, he remains an outcast, a remnant of personal and political battles he had with the psychoanalytical accreditation boards in his lifetime. The consensus being that the actual substance of the disagreements over training and session organization were irrelevant, that the academy at large found him a cocky asshole and banished him from accreditation and future analysts from calling themselves Lacanian.</p>\n<p>Lacan&#39;s work has found unexpected support in philosophy. His work, even if it&#39;s not literally true as a description of the development of the toddler, nevertheless is profoundly interesting. It provides a compelling answer for why people desire what they desire: they seek wholeness by attaining in themselves what the Other desires. I want to be what I think you want, and this recursive, alienated structure drives human longing.</p>\n<p>Lacan makes a compelling case for language as the foundation of psychology. The unconscious operates like a language, governed by the same rules of metaphor and substitution. a person can be understood by their &quot;master signifiers&quot;—those key words or ideas that shape their unconscious, carrying meanings far beyond their literal definitions and structuring how they see themselves and the world.</p>\n<p>I suspect that there are hundreds of interesting low-hanging results waiting from applying a Lacanian mindset to different intellectual fields. Some applications I&#39;d like to see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Movie or TV show writers: would love to see movie or TV show writers incorporate &quot;what are this character&#39;s master signifiers? Does he think in the symbolic or the imaginary realm?&quot; into their process.</li>\n<li>Whoever synthesizes the Lacanian unconscious with <strong>considerations</strong> in &quot;The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion&quot; deserves a Nobel prize.</li>\n<li>LLMs and metaphor. Attention is all you need, and language is the foundation of the unconscious. Define metaphor and substitution for an LLM (token for token? or token-phrase)</li>\n<li>Imagine the paper &quot;Environment and the shape of The Other&quot; which examines the relationship between TV / Internet usage, and what a survey determines to be the structure of The Other for that person. For example, see my essay on &quot;Comment Section Superego&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "content": "<h1>Contra Thematic Analysis, or: How i learned to stop worrying and memorize facts</h1>\n<p>Growing up, my literature curricula obsessed with analyzing deeper meanings. Each analysis took the form of transliterations of embodied truths. &quot;Transliteration&quot; because the truths themselves live in a different meaning-space: they exist as nonverbal embodied wisdom. When you transliterate deeper meanings to English you produce cliches like  &quot;sometimes it&#39;s the people you trusted most who betray you&quot;, or &quot;true love will stop at nothing&quot; or &quot;the arrogantly rich who sneers at his inferiors, is insecure next to the truly rich, who doesn&#39;t care about flashy status symbols&quot;.</p>\n<p>Transliterations are not translations, because they are incomplete. This is not controversial. Nobody upon reading Jane Austen claims to fully understand the experience of Georgian Era British aristocrats. And yet, in English class all through high school, we talked almost exclusively about these lossy transliterations. The shape of it was questions like : &quot;What do you think it represents that Jane Austen had the character rebuke this other one?&quot; and the correct answer being something like &quot;this was reflective of the social status of the time period between the lesser gentry and the more established nobles&quot;.</p>\n<p>Represents. Analyze. Themes. These are the hallmarks of thematic analysis. They are useless.</p>\n<h2>Memory</h2>\n<p>Thematic analysis is useless by one key metric: memorability. I remember zero of the thematic analysis I did in high school. What I remember from my literature curriculum were the bits unrelated to deeper meaning. Producing a movie recreating scenes from Julius Caesar. Memorizing Hamlet soliloquies. Reading the End of Something out loud and hitting the line &quot;It isn&#39;t fun anymore&quot;.</p>\n<p>Memory filters the embodied from the disembodied. What you remember years later is what stuck with you enough to survive years of mental erosion. Thematic analysis is too complicated for high schoolers, because it doesn&#39;t stick. Students will pattern match how to respond in discussions with templates: &quot;Going off that, I think that the windiness of the weather in the scene represents the characters changing personality with the seasons...&quot;.</p>\n<p>Stop it! You are teaching how to break the rules before you teach the rules! You are teaching freeform before you teach the constrained. Miles Davis went to Juliard after all, he was no Kerouac blabbering nonsense high in the night.  Something must be certain to be embodied. You cannot transmit embodied truths in English, by talking about them. You have to embody the story first, with simple things- recreate scenes, memorization, recitation. Just like music: you don&#39;t learn music by talking about it. You mimic other people&#39;s songs. You memorize them. You play them over and over.</p>\n<p>We don&#39;t elevate music critics above the music they critique. Why then, do we elevate literary analysis?</p>\n"

    "content": "<h1>Bad moods as a fragility test</h1>\n<p>Let&#39;s say you want to read more, to go to the gym, to study scientific papers in your free time, to make music. There&#39;s a style of advice that many people give. It&#39;s especially pronounced with hustlers and hustle culture.  The advice goes something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just wake up at 4 AM. Just force yourself to go to the gym. Just write a song. Just make yourself do extra math homework.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This technique fails on most people, because it is too hard. Musicians don&#39;t start randomly one day and write a song. They iterate over years-- starting with lessons their parents force them into, and then they perform oversimplified covers of easy rock songs, and then noodle on their guitar, and etc. The Beatles showed up to perform covers thousands of times before writing their famous works.</p>\n<p>&quot;Iterate on an oversimplified version of the thing&quot; is strong advice for how to improve at something. Playing covers is the simpler version of writing your own songs. Learning a language is hard, &quot;listen and repeat a 30 minute Pimsleur recording every day on your walk home from work&quot; is specific. You can force yourself through it when you are tired or hungover or just don&#39;t feel like it.</p>\n<p>Paul Graham <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html\">wrote</a> about small lies you tell yourself to get over the small cognitive hump of starting to work each day. He lies to himself by saying &quot;we&#39;ll just read an abstract for a couple minutes&quot;, and invariably he gets invested and reads the whole a 30 page document. Had he been upfront to himself about his intentions, he wouldn&#39;t have started.</p>\n<p>A simplified process is simple enough you can force yourself to do it in a bad mood. The complexity of your oversimplification increases with skill level. Really, the complexity of your oversimplification <em>defines</em> your skill level. For a professional jazz guitarist, &quot;noodling&quot; means playing the notes from a specific scale in a specific voicing off the cuff; for an amateur, noodling means playing an open C chord followed by an open G and an open D.</p>\n<p>People become experts by raising the baseline of their oversimplifications, NOT by forcing themselves to do the complicated thing.</p>\n<p>Bad moods act as a simplicity test. If it gets thrown away in a bad mood, if it is impossible in a bad mood, then it is too complicated. It is beyond my skill level.</p>\n"
